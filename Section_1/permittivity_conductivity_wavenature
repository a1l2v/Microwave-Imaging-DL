Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the last 3 prompts (so you can keep it for quick reference later):

---

### ðŸ”¹ Why scattering happens

* Microwaves travel smoothly in uniform tissue.
* At a **boundary with different properties (Îµ, Ïƒ)**, part of the wave bends or spreads out â†’ **scattering**.
* Larger contrast = stronger scattering (like a bigger stone making bigger ripples in water).

---

### ðŸ”¹ Role of permittivity vs conductivity

* **Permittivity (Îµ):**

  * Controls **wave speed**.
  * Change in permittivity â†’ change in speed â†’ wave bends (refraction) â†’ **main cause of direction change**.

* **Conductivity (Ïƒ):**

  * Controls **energy loss (attenuation)**.
  * Higher conductivity â†’ wave becomes weaker as it travels (absorbed into heat).
  * Does not really bend the wave, but affects **strength of scattered signal**.

### ðŸ”¹ Combined effect

* Together, they form **complex permittivity**:

  $$
  \tilde{\varepsilon} = \varepsilon - j\frac{\sigma}{\omega}
  $$
* **Îµ difference** â†’ bending/scattering.
* **Ïƒ difference** â†’ attenuation, uneven intensities, more realistic scattering patterns.

ðŸ‘‰ **Analogy:**

* **Permittivity** = road with changing speed limits â†’ car changes speed/direction.
* **Conductivity** = rough road â†’ car loses energy but doesnâ€™t change direction much.
